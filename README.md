# Grid
Power Grid Optimization Program for Data Structures Class

This project was done in a Data Structures Class in an attempt to better understand how Kruskal's algorithm works. 
The instructor provided an electrical grid that started at a source node S, and had many child nodes leading out 
of it. These child nodes also had child nodes of their own, resulting in a tree. It was the students' job to create
a minimum spanning tree from these nodes.
